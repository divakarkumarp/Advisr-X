## Agent Workflow Architectures

### Coordination Layer

The Advisr-X ‚ô£Ô∏è system uses a hierarchical agent architecture where a central supervisor agent coordinates the activities of specialized sub-agents:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Advisr-X‚ô£Ô∏è] --> B[Policy Expert Agent]
    A --> C[Claim Assistant Agent]
    A --> D[Service Finder Agent]
    A --> E[Policy Review Agent]
    
    B --> F[Policy Analysis]
    B --> G[Policy Comparison]
    
    C --> H[Claim Processing]
    C --> I[Resolution Tracking]
    
    D --> J[Network Search]
    D --> K[Provider Verification]
    
    E --> L[Review Analysis]
    E --> M[Feedback Aggregation]
```

### Agent Communication Flow

1. **Query Reception**
   - User input is received by the Advisr-X Supervisor
   - Natural language processing identifies query intent
   - Query is routed to appropriate specialized agent

2. **Task Execution**
   - Specialized agents process assigned tasks
   - Access relevant data sources and tools
   - Generate detailed responses
   - Handle sub-tasks independently

3. **Response Coordination**
   - Results are collected by supervisor
   - Cross-agent verification when needed
   - Final response compilation
   - Delivery to user with citations

### üîÑ State Management

1. **Conversation State**
   ```python
   class AgentState:
       conversation_history: List[Message]
       current_agent: str
       active_tasks: Dict[str, Task]
       context: Dict[str, Any]
   ```

2. **Agent States**
   - Policy Expert: Policy comparison and analysis state
   - Claim Assistant: Claim processing workflow state
   - Service Finder: Search and verification state
   - Policy Review: Feedback aggregation state

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

#### Agent Configuration
```python
# Example agent configuration
policy_expert = Agent.from_type(
    agent_type="policy_expert",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0),
    tools=[
        PolicySearchTool(),
        PolicyCompareTool(),
        CoverageLookupTool()
    ],
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)
```

#### Graph Definition
```python
# Example workflow graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("policy_expert", policy_expert)
workflow.add_node("claim_assistant", claim_assistant)

# Define edges
workflow.add_edge("policy_expert", "claim_assistant")
    .when(lambda state: state.requires_claim_info)
```
